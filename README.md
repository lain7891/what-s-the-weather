What-s-the-weather

This week’s assignment had us create a website that allowed you to search a city and once your button is clicked you would get today’s weather and the next five-day forecast. The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to use API’s by making request in your script to access their data. For this assignment we used the open weather API and dynamically add the weather of the city that is inputted in the search box.

# Installation

* Created a git repository
* Created and HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. 
* What I used to create my page:

* Document Object Model (DOM)
* Functions Calls
* Variable Created
* Console logging
* Event listeners
* For Loops
* Set Attributes
* Open Weather API

My struggle was getting the cards to only show up when the button was clicked and being able to add the icons into the current weather and cards. I utilized the help of my TA’s, tutors and classmates to put this together.
